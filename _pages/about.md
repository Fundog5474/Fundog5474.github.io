I am currently a student at [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/nsm/computer-science/) studying for my bachelors. I want to be a game developer. I want to make different types of games from first person shooters to open world RPGs. I want to get better at using game engines and hopefully make a game I can be proud of and people can enjoy.
